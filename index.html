           <p><h1><b>Into to DuckTales</b></h1>
                When Donald Duck decides to join the US Navy, <br>
                he enlists his uncle Scrooge McDuck to look after <br>
                his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Although reluctant<br>
                to do so due to their hyperactivity, along with his <br>
                continual pursuit of increasing his wealth and maintaining<br>
                harsh business ethics, he eventually warms up to them upon <br>
                seeing how smart and resourceful they are and takes them into<br>
                his manor as well as several adventures. Scrooge McDuck is well<br>
                known for his characteristic Scottish accent, spats, and top hat. <br>
                We later learn in the series his family comes from Castle McDuck, <br>
                and he came to America when younger learning how to “work smarter not harder”. <br>
                In addition to them, the show features frequent appearances by Gyro Gearloose, <br>
                an established comic book character, as well as guest appearances by Donald in the <br>
                first season – this was either a full appearance, or in a cameo scene when Scrooge <br>
                and his nephews read letters he sends to them, and a few minor appearances by Scrooge's <br>
                old flame, Glittering Goldie, whose character was adapted from the comic books. The show <br>
                introduced new characters to the Duck universe; while some were minor including the nanny <br>
                Mrs. Beakley, whom Scrooge hires to babysit the nephews; Mrs. Beakley's granddaughter Webby;<br>
                Scrooge's pilot Launchpad McQuack; Doofus Drake, an admirer of Launchpad and a close friend <br>
                of the nephews; and the McDuck Manor butler, Duckworth. The second season later introduced<br> 
                three new additional characters as part of the show's stories: "caveduck" Bubba Duck and his pet<br> 
                triceratops Tootsie; and Fenton Crackshell, Scrooge's personal accountant who secretly works as <br>
                a superhero named Gizmoduck.

                The show's primary villains consist of those from the comics: <br>
                Flintheart Glomgold, who seeks to replace Scrooge as the "richest duck in the world";<br>
                the Beagle Boys, who seek to rob Scrooge of his fortune and often target his money bin; <br>
                and Magica De Spell, who seeks to steal his Number One Dime. A few changes were made to these<br>
                villains – unlike the comics, Flintheart is of Scottish descent and wears a couple of pieces<br>
                of Scottish attire, including a kilt; Magica, who is Italian in the comics, has an Eastern <br>
                European accent, always saying “darling” (which shocks Scrooge in an episode when Magica <br>
                changes into the form of Mrs. Beakly). She has a brother named Poe, who was transformed into<br>
                a raven; the Beagle Boys have individual personalities and are headed by their mother,<br>
                Ma Beagle, who sometimes springs them from jail to conduct schemes with her, but always avoids<br>
                being caught by the police. The animated series also featured a list of minor villains, most <br>
                of whom sought to either claim Scrooge's wealth or beat him to treasure.<br>

                </p> Most of the stories used in the show revolve around one of three common themes – the first focuses on <br>
                the group's efforts to thwart attempts by various villains to steal Scrooge's fortune or his Number One Dime;<br>
                the second focuses on a race for treasure; the third focused on specific characters within the show. Although some <br>
                stories are original or based on Barks' comic book series, others are pastiches on classical stories or legends, including<br>
                characters based on either fictional or historical persons. DuckTales is well noted for its many references to popular culture,<br>
                including Shakespeare, Jack the Ripper, Greek mythology, James Bond, Indiana Jones, and Sherlock Holmes. After its first season,<br>
                the show moved away from globe-trotting stories, with adventures focused mainly within Duckburg.
